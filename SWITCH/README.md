## 🌐 Overview

A **network switch** is a device that connects multiple devices (PCs, servers, routers, OLTs) within a Local Area Network (LAN).  
Switches intelligently forward network traffic based on MAC addresses, manage VLANs, enable trunking, and support protocols like STP to prevent loops.  
This folder contains **configuration examples, troubleshooting commands, and best practices** for network switches.
